Of course, not every game in The Jackbox Party Pack 4 is perfect. Some reviewers and players have criticized some of the games for being too complicated, too slow, too random, or too dependent on the quality of the players.

Civic Doodle can be frustrating or dull if the players are not good at drawing or voting.
 
However, these flaws are minor compared to the overall fun and enjoyment that The Jackbox Party Pack 4 provides.
